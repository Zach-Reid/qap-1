The Front End Technology assignment for QAP 1.


Reflection questions:

1.	How many hours did it take you to complete this assessment? (Please keep try to keep track of how many hours you have spent working on each individual part of this assessment as best you can - an estimation is fine; we just want a rough idea.)

It took me around 11 hours to finish this assignment.

2.	What online resources you have used? (My lectures, YouTube, Stack overflow etc.)

I used the linked resources when getting acceptable stock images. I used Youtube for a video link and downloaded an MP3 from Soundcloud for the audio. Online resources were the HTML websites such as w3schools. I also used sites like the Jeep website and car reviews to research the model of car I used.

3.	Did you need to ask any of your friends in solving the problems. (If yes, please mention name of the friend. They must be amongst your class fellows.)

I did not need to talk to any friends for this.

4.	Did you need to ask questions to any of your instructors? If so, how many questions did you ask (or how many help sessions did you require)?

I did not need to ask any questions or get help sessions.

5.	Rate (subjectively) the difficulty of Making this all! from your own perspective, and whether you feel confident that you can solve a similar but different problem requiring some of the same techniques in the future now that youâ€™ve completed this one.

This was not as hard as the last time I did this assignment. Out of the QAP 1 assignments, this was the most difficult due to the added amount of work of managing several web pages and a stylesheet. I feel like I can do problems like this one in the future.
